Using Limes
-----------

"limes" is an executable package: you have to "import" the package directory.
Thus, include the "limes" parent directory in PYTHONPATH, then :

	% python -m limes

Prerequisite
------------

- Python version needed : 3.7 or above.

- If you want to load .xls or .xlsx files, you need to install the "xlrd" package :
	https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/
	Note that in this case, Python version cannot be above 3.7.
